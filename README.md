Evaluating Stacking Ensemble Machine Learning Model for Early PCOS Detection:

Built a binary classification model on a kaggle dataset. Cleaned and processed the dataset, handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled features for model readiness.
Applied SMOTE to address class imbalance and built a stacking ensemble model with K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Random Forest as base classifiers, and Logistic Regression as the meta-classifier.
Achieved 94.5% accuracy and AUC-ROC of 0.94, enabling early PCOS screening support.
