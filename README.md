Evaluating Stacking Ensemble Machine Learning Model for Early PCOS Detection:

Built a binary classification model using clinical data. Cleaned and processed the dataset, handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled features for model readiness.
Applied SMOTE to address class imbalance and developed a stacking ensemble model with K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Random Forest as base classifiers, and Logistic Regression as the meta-classifier.
Achieved 94.5% accuracy and an AUC-ROC of 0.94, enabling early PCOS screening support.
